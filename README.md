# message.fullstack.cash

This is an IPFS-enabled Gatsby app that allows people to send end-to-end (e2e) encrypted messages to each other. The experience is similar to webmail. Bitcoin Cash addresses are used instead of email addresses. IPFS and the Bitcoin Cash blockchain is used to transfer the content instead of SMTP.

This repository was forked from [bch-wallet-starter](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-starter), which is based on [wallet.fullstack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash). It incorporates the same e2e encryption that is demoed in the [encrypt-msg](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/encrypt-msg) command line app.
